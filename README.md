# Compound-Wallet

This wallet allows you to deposit DAI and then sends the DAI into the Compound Finance Protocol. 

You'll then receive cDAI. The DAI you send to Compound will gain interest every block. When you want to withdraw your DAI, the wallet allows 
you to send you cDAI and get back your DAI + interest.

# How To Set Up

Clone this repo and then run npm install to install the dependencies.

Fork the Mainnet and run Dai.js to first deposit DAI into your account.
